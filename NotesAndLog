Q1
On trying different split function
- May be better to stick to simple (ie linear) split features for WEAK learners
  -> meant to be linearly combined to form strong learner
  -> should be learning simple features
  -> "it is empirically proved that a weak feature (axis-aligned, two-pixel tests) has already work well"
      --- Randomised Decision Forests for Classification, slide 15 - on non-linear weak learner
- Suggestion: linear split functions with form y = ax + b
  -> two params --- enough complexity
  -> still easy to implement --- compare value above/below function
