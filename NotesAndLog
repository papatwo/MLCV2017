Q1
On trying different split function
- May be better to stick to simple (ie linear) split features for WEAK learners
  -> meant to be linearly combined to form strong learner
  -> should be learning simple features
  -> "it is empirically proved that a weak feature (axis-aligned, two-pixel tests) has already work well"
      --- Randomised Decision Forests for Classification, slide 15 - on non-linear weak learner
- Suggestion: linear split functions with form y = ax + b
  -> two params --- enough complexity
  -> still easy to implement --- compare value above/below function

Q3
[FRAMES, DESCRS] = VL_PHOW(IM) extracts PHOW features from the image IM. PHOW is simply dense SIFT applied at several resolutions. 

DESCRS: 
Each column is a feature frame (descriptor) and has the format [X;Y;S;TH]
X,Y : (fractional) center of the frame
S : scale
TH : orientation (in radians)

VLFeat SIFT descriptor uses the following convention. The y axis points downwards and angles are measured clockwise (to be consistent with the standard image convention).
The 3-D histogram (consisting of 8×4×4=1288×4×4=128 bins) is stacked as a single 128-dimensional vector,
where the fastest varying dimension is the orientation and the slowest the y spatial coordinate.


desc_tr (DESCRS in RF-2017)
10x15 cell  (15 images @ class)
each cell is struct (128xn , n ~ 200 to 300) with columns of descriptors

desc_sel (100k descriptors)
128x100000 single


[centres, assignments] = vl_kmeans(desc_sel, 10, 'Initialization', 'plusplus');
centres 128x10singles
assignments 100000 uint (labels)
